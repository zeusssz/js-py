# JavaScript to Python Translator

This project is a simple tool that translates JavaScript code into Python. It aims to provide a basic conversion for common JavaScript constructs, making it easier for developers to transition between the two languages.

## Features

- Converts variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`) to Python-style variables.
- Translates function declarations to Python functions.
- Replaces `console.log` with `print`.
- Handles control structures like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.
- Converts JavaScript array and object literals to Python lists and dictionaries.
- Supports ternary operators, promises, and basic async/await syntax.
- Translates common array methods like `push`, `pop`, `map`, and `filter`.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeusssz/js-py.git
   cd js-py
   ```

2. **Prepare your JavaScript file:**
   Place your JavaScript code in a `.js` file.

3. **Run the translator:**
   ```bash
   python translator.py
   ```

4. **Output:**
   The translated Python code will be saved in `translated.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Python syntax.

## Limitations

- This translator handles basic constructs and may not cover all edge cases or advanced JavaScript features.
- Certain JavaScript functionalities (like DOM manipulation) do not have direct Python equivalents.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality of this translator.
